# EasyBeat-Medical-Fit-Band-for-senior-population

This repository contains the source code for a web-based application designed to work in conjunction with the EasyBeat Medical Fit Band, a wearable device specifically tailored for senior citizens. The EasyBeat system empowers seniors to monitor their heart rate conveniently and receive timely assistance in case of emergencies.

Key Features:
- Real-Time Heart Rate Monitoring: The EasyBeat Fit Band continuously tracks the user's heart rate and transmits the data wirelessly to a user-friendly web interface. Seniors can easily view their current heart rate readings at a glance.
- Visualized Data: The web interface presents heart rate data in a clear and concise manner, making it easy for seniors to understand their heart health status and identify any potential trends or concerns.
SOS Alerts: The system incorporates a built-in SOS functionality. If a senior's heart rate exceeds a predefined threshold (indicating a potential medical emergency), an SOS message is automatically sent to designated caregivers or emergency services.
- User-Friendly Interface: The web interface is designed with seniors in mind, prioritizing simplicity and ease of use. Large fonts, clear navigation, and minimal clutter ensure a smooth user experience.
- Companion Mobile App (Optional): An optional companion mobile app can be developed to provide additional convenience for seniors and their caregivers. The app could allow for remote heart rate monitoring, alert notifications, and potentially, basic health data management features.

Target Users:
Seniors who want to proactively monitor their heart health and maintain independence.
Caregivers of seniors who seek a reliable and convenient solution to remotely monitor their loved ones' well-being.
Healthcare professionals who can leverage the EasyBeat system as a complementary tool for patient monitoring and care management.
